# Hack Description
Our tool gives users bite-sized information about insurance—why you might need it, they different types that State Farm offers, and the best policies for you—all guided by Jake from State Farm! 

Our UI makes the insurance buying process more conversational and transparent– a direction that State Farm has to move toward to stay competitive and attract younger buyers. As college students, we think this web application will help make understanding insurance less intimidating.

We built our application with ReactJS and NodeJS, as well as various libraries supported by these frameworks. To ensure the design conformed to State Farm design standards, we styled our application with 1x. All of the logos used throughout the application were hand-drawn by one of our team members.
